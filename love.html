<center><i>If I can gain your love, I could even become a monster with joy...</i></center><br><p align="justify">Love and Hate. The two most prominent and powerful emotions one can have. Being rejected by one you love can result in a total change in direction and views of the world. Loving someone in secret can also lead to sacrifices. Lets explore Sasame's loves and those who loved him in this section.<br><br><img src="images/lovetakako.jpg" align=left>Her name is Takako. She was another Pretear from a long time (16 yrs) ago and Sasame has loved her from the beginning. He withdrew his emotions and held them in when he noticed that Takako was interested in Hayate. Sasame was never visible to Takako. In Takako's mind and heart, there was only Hayate. Sasame told himself to stay true to his friends and to their purpose, and disregard love. Unfortunately, Takako turned into Saihi Fenrir later and offered herself and her powers to evil. Sasame and the others were forced to seal her away, and thus, Sasame sealed her love away into darkness. Ever since then, no matter how many people's hearts were healed by the Liefe Knights, his own heart was never mended. Sasame's love for her was so great that he left his duty as a Liefe Knight and joined her in the dark side in order to be with her. It is absolutely forbidden for a Liefe Knight to be with Saihi, one who takes away Liefe. But Sasame disregarded this, and everything else, to be with Takako. He would come immediately at her call and do exactly as she wished to prove his love. He brought Saihi into Leafenia, and when Saihi told him to kill Hayate to prove his love, he went to do so willingly, without any persuasion or spells from Saihi. Saihi told him to battle Hayate more than once, and he never denied her request or persuaded her to change her mind. He is even willing to give his Liefe to her, thus sacrificing himself. Sasame risked his life to save Saihi, and thus died as millions of root vines pierced through him ;_; With this, Saihi finally felt real love and returned to Takako. Sasame was finally able to see Takako smile for him, and he finally retired to his death after seeing her happy again...Yes, in the end, Himeno gave them enough liefe to bring them back to life again. :D<br><br><img src="images/lovemawata.jpg" align=right>Her name is Mawata. She is one of Himeno's stepsisters and she's usually very quiet. Her greatest wish was for someone to love her, to hold her, and to care for her after the death of her father. She didn't feel any of that in her family. Her mother and stepfather were always together, her stepsister rarely talked to her, and no one really bothered her. In fact, the closest person to her is probably the maid, who had hidden agendas and a use for her...She found comfort by tuning in and listening to Sasame's voice reading her deepest thoughts in postcards. She grew very fond of him and even bought him flowers. She and Sasame have met before, but Sasame more or less thought of her as a troubled child and fan who frequently writes postcards to him. She wouldn't have had a role to play in Saihi's intentions, except for the fact that she was so confused and felt misunderstood by the entire town. Saihi used her emotions to create hatred in her, and then used her soul as a protection shell for Fenrir. Sasame was sent to lure her out of the mansion, saying that he understood her feelings and promised to free her of them forever. Her heart was then broken by him as she watched Sasame embrace Saihi. With that, all hope is gone and Saihi can freely use her for her own purposes. She was later saved by Himeno and her family, and she learned that she was indeed loved by many and they will change their ways for her.
