So, now that we're down to business, lets take a look at Sasame's somewhat complex personality that makes him who he is. XD<br><br><table border="0" bgcolor="black" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style=" Border: solid 1 white ;filter: Alpha(Opacity=80, FinishOpacity=0, Style=1);" width="80%" style="font-size: 11px"><TR><TD style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; color: #ffffff"><b>&nbsp;Understanding</b></font></TR></table><p><table width=300><div align=justify><img src="images/persasame.jpg" align=left>Sasame is very understanding of most situations, and this is shown too many times throughout the series. The obvious example is that his job is a radio personality, and he must be capable of understanding other people's feelings and how to reassure them and give wise advice. He also understands the reason Hayate is hesitant to find the next Pretear and use her powers. Since he has a close relationship with Hayate, he has a very good understanding of him and thus knew when Hayate had found the Pretear, dispite the fact that Hayate hadn't said anything. Sasame would also know where Hayate would go when he needs to think and such. Sasame was also very understanding when Himeno wanted to practice becoming Pretear and attacking. He was a wonderful teacher and Himeno quickly learned to manipulate sound. However, as with everyone, Sasame's understanding has its limits. He did not truely understand Mawata's feelings and manipulated her feelings for the dark side. However, this is out of love for Takako of course. Everything he does for the dark side is for Takako's happiness. For Takako, he is willing to do anything and everything.<br><br><table border="0" bgcolor="black" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style=" Border: solid 1 white ;filter: Alpha(Opacity=80, FinishOpacity=0, Style=1);" width="80%" style="font-size: 11px"><TR><TD style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 11px; color: #ffffff"><b>&nbsp;Gentle</b></font></TR></table><p><table width=300><div align=justify><img src="images/persasame0.jpg" align=right>One of Sasame's best qualities is that he is very gentle and sweet. He is almost always seen with a gentle smile or a kind expression on his face. In the beginning, Himeno was quite taken with him and said that Hayate should be more like him.^-^ He is able to use his gentle voice for his day job as a radio personality. He can sprout excellent poetry in a blink of an eye. Many fans are taken with him and crowd outside the radio station in hope of a glimpse of him. He isn't angered easily at all, but when he does get angry, it's very threatening and menacing.<br><br><table border="0" bgcolor="black" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style=" Border: solid 1 white ;filter: Alpha(Opacity=80, FinishOpacity=0, Style=1);" width="80%" style="font-size: 11px"><TR><TD style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 11px; color: #ffffff"><b>&nbsp;Dedicated</b></font></TR></table><p><table width=300><div align=justify><img src="images/persasame00.jpg" align=left>Sasame is very much dedicated to his responsibility as a Liefe Knight. He protects the people and the Pretear and aid in any way he can. He is constantly putting himself in danger for the Pretear and looking for ways to avoid fighting. He tries to reason with Takako, to get her to stop taking Liefe away from every living thing. But even with his hypnotic persuasions, he could not turn her back. Therefore, he chose to give up being a Liefe Knight for her. Some may say that he's not very dedicated to his duty as a Liefe Knight here. But he has simply changed his dedication. He loves Takako so much that he's willing to sacrifice his friends' trust and well deserved respect for her. He has dedicated himself to her and put forth all of his effort in an attempt to win her love. He even sacrifices himself for her. In the end, she is touched by his efforts and the two are finally able to understand each other's feelings.
